Modernize the deployment of bastion servers on AWS to enhance user experience, align with best practices, and develop reusable components for future projects.


1.  Identification of Stakeholders and gather existing deployment processes (1/2 sprint)

	1.1  Identify who has the most knowledge about the current process and any documentation related to it.
	1.2  Gather all available documentation related to the current deployment process, note down any discrepancies or gaps in the documentation for clarification. Create a flowchart or diagram representing the current deployment process if needed.
	1.3  Analyze to identify bottlenecks, redundancies, or areas that might benefit from automation.
	1.4  Identify who has the most knowledge about the current process and any documentation related to it.
	1.5  List down all tools, platforms, and systems involved in the deployment.

2.  Hands-on Review of the current process.  This provides invaluable insights that are often missed in theoretical discussions. This step ensures that the modernization effort is rooted in real-world scenarios, making the subsequent improvements more effective and relevant. (1/2 sprint)
	
	2.1. Participate in a Live Deployment
	2.2. Coordinate with the subject matter expert on the team to be present during a scheduled deployment. This gives a firsthand experience of the entire process. Pay close attention to the sequence of steps, interactions between different tools, and any manual interventions required.
	2.3  Document any workarounds or manual fixes applied to address these challenges and understand the root causes of such challenges. 

3.  Research/Design Solution (1/2 sprint)

	3.1. Brainstorm & Ideate and prioritize criteria (e.g., cost, efficiency, scalability, user-friendliness).
	3.2. Document all potential solutions and Compare the brainstormed solutions against the evaluation criteria.
	3.3. Estimate the cost of implementing each solution.

4.  Develop a Proof of concept (1 sprint)

	4.1 create an environment which optimized for fast iteration
	4.2 creating a MVP of the solution, and evaluating its performance in a controlled environment to identify potential strengths and weaknesses.
	4.3 Based on feedback and test results, make any necessary modifications to enhance the solution or address any challenges.

5.  Implementation (1 sprint)
	
	5.1 Develop code leveraging DevX cloudstack. 
	5.2 leveraging AWS best practices

6.  Testing (1/2 sprint)
	
	Test the solution to ensure it meets the specified requirements and is free from defects.
	Implement iterative cycles of testing, feedback, and refinements
	Monitor the solution's performance against predefined KPIs

7.  Deployment (1/2 sprint)

	Deploy to preprod environment
	Deploy to prod environment

8.  Documentation (2 points)
