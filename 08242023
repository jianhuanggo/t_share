IIPC-3310: Need more clarity for swagging

What constitute a perf auto-failover? I guess it is related to bastion decomp? 

Is there a current approach to create a Amazon CloudWatch alarm? If so, is there any documentation?

Which Slack channels should be notified when a performance auto-failover occurs?  

What information should be included in the Slack notification? 

What should happen if there's an issue with sending notifications to Slack? Is there a fallback mechanism? 

What measures will be taken to ensure proper monitoring of this process and to receive notifications in the event of failure?


IIPC-3335: changed to 4 points 

IIPC-3312: are we building a repeatable process to alert when such security concern do occur?  If so, do we have a current framework to similar such alerts?  Need more clarity for swagging
